# ombdapi-movie-database-search

Create a simple page showing a search input field. When the user types in a title of the movie, fetch the list of results from this [API](http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=blade&apikey=BanMePls). and show them in the DOM. When you are done, add support for multiple results to your application - Using the API's parameter `s` instead of `t` allows us to get a list of movies based on a search query. Show the new result format in a list of movies in the DOM.
- Bonus points if you are able to add a checkbox or a dropdown concerning the type of release (valid types are: movie, series, episode). Add support for this new query parameter to your API call.
